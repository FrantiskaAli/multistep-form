## My challenges
I found this project challenging and I am grateful that I decided to try. 
Firstly I did struggle with understanding how to correctly pass form data to the parent element, and then ran into trouble once more realizing next.js needs a special conditioning when setting local storage.
I did use help when setting custom checkboxes , found that to be a tough one as well.
Other than then I did my best to achieve desired design and believe I was rather successful.
